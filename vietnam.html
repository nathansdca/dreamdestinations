                        <p class="card-text">If you truly want to see all the beauty of Halong Bay then you need to take to the water and sign up for a boat cruise.
                            With some 2,000 islands to choose from, you will have lots of different options about where you want to go and what you want to see, from the main ‘big hits’ to less well known and smaller islands.
                            Many of the boats used are built in the traditional style and are known as ‘junk boats’. Depending on the tour operator you can also enjoy a buffet meal as part of the cruise or even stay on the boat overnight for a truly memorable cruising experience.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Hang Sung Sot Cave is located at Bon Hon Island and you will need to hike up a steep path to get here, although it is worth the effort for the inner views.
                            The inner chamber is known for having a number of stone formations that are said to look like sentries lining up and there is even a stone in the center of the cave that looks like a general talking to his troops.
                            As the light streams across the water and makes flickering patterns on the inside of the cave, it looks as if the formations are coming to life.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Cat Ba Island sits around an ancient fisherman’s port and as such has a relaxed atmosphere that makes it the perfect place to spend an afternoon.
                            One of the best things to do here is to rent a bicycle and ride to the idyllic countryside just outside the main town.
                            This is also the spot where many of the boats leave for island trips so it makes a good place to base yourself while you are in Halong Bay.

                            Once inside however, the chamber opens up and you will find winding tunnels that are covered in gorgeous stalagmites and stalactites.
                            There are also fossils in the cave so if you are a fan of spelunking then this is a great spot to explore for an afternoon.

                            There is no better way to tour Halong Bay than by cycling down to the various beaches on Cat Ba Island and the going for a refreshing swim at the end of a long bike ride.

                            There is a shrine now inside the grotto to commemorate the legend and this is a top attraction in Halong Bay.

                            Here you will find a variety of local fruits and vegetables and you can also check out the local seafood.
                            There are huge mounds of crabs, jump shrimp and fish here, and if you want to set up your own beach barbecue later then this is the place to source your produce.

                        <p class="card-text">Halong Bay is located by the sea, and so it stands to reason that there is a plethora of seafood on offer here.
                            Many of the restaurants here are located along the central beaches and you can dine with your feet in the sand and sample the freshest catch of the day.
                            Just some of these include baked king prawns as well as squid, crab, and lobster.
                            If you prefer there are also self-barbecue fire pits where you can have a go at cooking your own dinner.

                        <p class="card-text">Dau Be Island is a great spot if you want to go swimming or diving.
                            The reason for this is due to the amazing coral gardens here as well as deep grottoes which are located inside three large lakes.
                            If you want to get the underground cave and grottoes then you need to row across to them at low tide which is the only time that you will be able to climb inside.

                            To get to the fort you need to walk up a hill to the main gate and you can check out underground tunnels here as well as a number of attractions such as gun emplacements.

                            You can of course stop here to top up your tan or go for a swim, but the main reason to visit is for the cliff top paths here.
                            The cliff side has a walking trail that will take you to other beaches like Cat Ba 1 and 2 and this is one of the best walks on the island.
